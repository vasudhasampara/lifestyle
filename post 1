<p>Lagerfeld's time at Chanel and Fendi, as well as his eponymous label, will make up the bulk of the exhibit. But it will also look back to his time at Balmain, where he spent three years as an apprentice in the 1950s; Patou, where he was involved in the design of 10 haute couture collections; and Chloé, where he was the sole designer for six years.</p>
